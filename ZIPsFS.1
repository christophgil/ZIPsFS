.SH Summary
.PP
ZIPsFS functions as a \f[B]union or overlay\f[R] file system, merging
multiple file structures into a unified directory.
This directory presents the underlying files and sub-directories from
the specified sources (branches) as a single, cohesive structure.
Any newly created or modified files are stored in the first file
location, while all other sources remain read-only, ensuring that their
files are never altered.
ZIPsFS treats \f[B]ZIP files as expandable folders\f[R], typically
naming them by appending \f[V].Contents/\f[R] to the original ZIP file
name.
However, this behavior can be customized using filename-based rules.
Extensive configuration options allow adjustments.
Changes can be applied without disrupting the file system.
.PP
With a trailing slash, the folder name is not part of the virtual path,
in accordance with the trailing slash semantics of many UNIX tools.
.PP
ZIPsFS includes specialized features like \f[B]automatic file
conversions\f[R] and performance optimizations tailored for efficiently
storing and accessing \f[B]large-scale mass spectrometry\f[R] data.
It manages non-sequential file reading from varying positions (so-called
file seek) efficiently to improve reading of remote and zipped files.
It has a programming interface to create synthetic file content
programmatically.
.PP
ZIPsFS is best run in a \f[B]tmux\f[R] session.
.SH Mini tutorial
.PP
Please Install ZIPsFS.
.SS Create some example files
.PP
Without trailing slash, the folder name will be retained in the virtual
path.
This is the case for \f[V]branch3\f[R].
Virtual file paths in that branch will start with \f[I]mount
point\f[R]\f[V]/branch3/\f[R].

The script file ZIPsFS_prepare_branch_for_ftp.sh generates an example

used in ZIPsFS.
.PP
Above command line to start ZIPsFS can extended to include this folder:

ZIPsFS   $b1 $b2 $b3 $b4  --preload \[ti]/.ZIPsFS/DBcurlftpfs  :  \[ti]/test/ZIPsFS/mnt

.PP
Due to the option \f[V]--preload\f[R], files are mirrord to the first
branch on the local file system for fast access.
Lets try
.IP
.nf
\f[C]

\f[R]

.PP
GZ compressed files are transparently de-compressed.
Files with the ending \f[V].gz\f[R] also appear in the file listing
without gz suffix.
Initially, they have an estimated file size.
After reading the virtual file, the exact length of the decompressed
data is known.
.SS Considerations
.PP
Performance: Without a trailing slash in the command line, the folder
name \f[V]/DBcurlftpfs/\f[R] will be the beginning of virtual paths.
This is important for performance, because it avoids that the curlftpfs
file systems will be requested for each file lookup.
Only if virtual paths start with \f[V]/DBcurlftpfs/\f[R], curlftpfs gets
involved.
.PP
Stability: There are several open questions.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
- Is curlftpfs stable? Does it reliably reconnect?
- What if requests hang, will it become responding again after  timeout?
\f[R]

.PP
Tests and further optimizations might be needed.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS ZIPsFS is a Union / overlay file system
.PP
ZIPsFS functions as a union (overlay) file system.
When files are created or modified, they are stored in the first file
tree.
If a file exists in multiple source locations, the version from the
leftmost source (the first one listed) takes precedence.
With an empty string as the first source, the ZIPsFS file system
read-only and file creation and modification is disabled.
.PP
The physical file path, i.e., the actual storage location of a file, can
be retrieved from a file formed by appending \f[V]\[at]SOURCE.TXT\f[R]
to the filename.
For example, to determine the real location of:
\f[V]\[ti]/test/ZIPsFS/mnt/1.txt\f[R] Run the following command:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
cat \[ti]/test/ZIPsFS/mnt/1.txt\[at]SOURCE.TXT
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If a remote upstream file system stops responding, the current file
access is blocked (Unless the options \f[V]WITH_ASYNC_READDIR\f[R] \&...
are activated).
After some time, unresponsive upstream file trees will be skipped to
prevent that file accesses get blocked.
.SS ZIPsFS expands ZIP file entries
.PP
By default, ZIP files are displayed as folders with the suffix
\f[V].Content\f[R].
This behavior can be customized.
The default configuration includes a few exceptions tailored to specific
use cases in Mass Spectrometry:
.IP \[bu] 2
For ZIP files whose names end with \f[I].d.Zip\f[R], the virtual folder
will end with \f[I].d\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
Flat file list: For Sciex instruments, each mass spectrometry record is
stored in a set of files which are not organized in sub-folders.
For example the record
\f[V]20231122_MA_HEK_QC_hiFlow_2ug_SWATH_rep01\f[R] stored in
\f[V]20231122_MA_HEK_QC_hiFlow_2ug_SWATH_rep01.wiff2.Zip\f[R] may
consist of the following files
.RS 2
.IP \[bu] 2
20231122_MA_HEK_QC_hiFlow_2ug_SWATH_rep01.timeseries.data
.IP \[bu] 2
20231122_MA_HEK_QC_hiFlow_2ug_SWATH_rep01.wiff
.IP \[bu] 2
20231122_MA_HEK_QC_hiFlow_2ug_SWATH_rep01.wiff2
.IP \[bu] 2
20231122_MA_HEK_QC_hiFlow_2ug_SWATH_rep01.wiff.scan
.PP
These are contained with those of other entries in the file listing.
To get the full list of files, all ZIP files need to be inspected.
This is time consuming and performed in the background.
Consequently, the file listing will be incomplete when requested for the
first time.
Only after some seconds, the file listing will be presented properly.
.RE
.SS File content pre-load
.PP
Non-linear file loading in a random-access manner is inefficient for
remote or ZIP-compressed files.
This is the case for the MS-programs Diann and FragPipe (Fragger).
More preload
.PP
File types are specified in the configurable method
\f[V]config_advise_cache_in_ram()\f[R].
The default setting includes Brukertimstof files.
Preloading to the RAM is appropriate for these files because each file
is loaded only once per analysis.
The \f[V]-l\f[R] option sets an upper limit on memory usage for the ZIP
RAM cache.
When available memory runs low, ZIPsFS can either pause, proceed without
caching file data or just ignore the memory restriction depending on the
configuration.
.PP
For Thermo raw files analyzed in FragPipe, preloading entire files into
RAM would be inappropriate because each raw file is opened and closed
multiple times during computation.
In this case prefetch remote or compressed files to the local disk is
the best choice.
.PP
All remote (r) or compressed (c) or zippded (z) files accessed through
the following folders will be first copied to local disk:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
<mount-point>/ZIPsFS/lr/
<mount-point>/ZIPsFS/lrc/
<mount-point>/ZIPsFS/lrz/    # use this for FragPipe
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Periodically ZIPsFS will call
\f[V]<path-of-branch1>/ZIPsFS/ZIP_cleanup.sh\f[R].
This customizable script can cleanup old files to free up disk space.
Additional caching mechanisms are designed to accelerate file listing in
large directories for ZIP entries.
