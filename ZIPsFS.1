.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS Summary
.PP
ZIPsFS acts as a union or overlay file system.
It combines multiple file structures into one, resulting in a single
directory structure that contains underlying files and sub-directories
from the given sources.
Created or modified files are stored in the first file location.
The other file sources are read-only and files will never be modified.
ZIPsFS expands ZIP files as folders.
Normally, the folder name is formed from the ZIP file name by appending
\[lq].Contents/\[rq].
This can be changed with rules based on file name patterns.
Extensive configuration is possible without interrupting the file
system.
Specific features and performance tweaks meet our needs for storing
large data from mass spectrometry experiments.
.SS Configuration
.PP
The default behavior can be modified with rules based on file names in
\f[I]ZIPsFS_configuration.h\f[R] and \f[I]ZIPsFS_configuration.c\f[R].
For changes to take effect, re-compilation and restart is necessary.
Using the \f[I]-s symlink\f[R] option, the configuration can be changed
without interrupting the file system.
Ongoing computations with file access to the ZIPsFS are not affected.
.SS Union / overlay file system
.PP
ZIPsFS is a union or overlay file system.
Several file locations are combined to one.
All files in the source file trees (in above example command three
sources) can be accessed via the mount point (in the example
\f[I]~/mnt/ZIPsFS\f[R]).
When files are created or modified, they will be stored in the first
file tree (in the example \f[I]~/tmp/ZIPsFS/writable\f[R]).
If files exist in two locations, the left most source file system takes
precedence.
.PP
New files are created in the first file tree, while the following file
trees are not modified.
If an empty string \[lq]\[rq] or \[cq]\[cq] is given for the first
source, no writable source is used.
.SS ZIP files
.PP
Let \f[I]file.zip\f[R] be a ZIP file in any of the source file systems.
It will appear in the virtual file system together with a folder
\f[I]file.zip.Content\f[R].
Normally, the folder name is formed by appending
\[lq]\f[I].Content\f[R]\[rq] to the zip file name.
This can be changed in \f[I]ZIPsFS_configuration.c\f[R].
.PP
For example Sciex mass spectrometry software requires that the
containing files are shown directly in the file listing rather than in a
sub-folder.
.SS Cache
.PP
Optionally, ZIPsFS can read certain ZIP entries entirely into RAM and
provide the data from the RAM copy at higher speed.
This may improve performance for compressed ZIP entries that are read
from varying positions in the file, so-called file file-seek.
With the option \f[B]-l\f[R] an upper limit of memory consumption for
the ZIP RAM cache is specified.
.PP
Further caches aim at faster file listing of large directories.
.SS Logs
.PP
It is recommended to run ZIPsFS in the foreground with option
\f[I]-f\f[R] within a persistent terminal multiplexer like
\f[I]tmux\f[R].
.PP
Log files are found in \f[B]\[ti]/.ZIPsFS/\f[R].
.PP
An HTML file with status information is dynamically generated in the
generated folder \f[B]ZIPsFS\f[R] in the virtual ZIPsFS file system.
.SS Plugins - Auto-generation of virtual files
.PP
ZIPsFS can display virtual files which do not exist, but which are
generated automatically when used.
This feature must be activated in ZIPsFS_configuration.h.
The first file root is used to store the generated files.
.PP
A typical use-case are file conversions.
Auto-generated files are displayed in the virtual file tree in
\f[B]ZIPsFS/a/\f[R].
If they have not be used before, an estimated file size is reported as
the real file size is not yet known.
.PP
The currently included examples demonstrate this feature and can serve
as a templated for own settings.
.PP
For this purpose copy image or pdf files into one of the roots and visit
the respective folder in the virtual file system.
Prepend this folder with \f[B]ZIPsFS/a/\f[R] and you will see the
generated files:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
mnt=<path of mountpoint>

mkdir $mnt/test

cp file.png $mnt/test/

ls -l $mnt/ZIPsFS/a/test/

.PP
When opening these files for the first time there will be some delay.
This is because the files need to be generated.
When accessed a second time, the data comes without delay, because the
file is already there.
Furthermore, the file size will be correct.
When the upstream file changes or the last-modified attribute is
updated, derived files will be generated again.
.PP
Users can deactivate or add conversions by editing
ZIPsFS_configuration_autogen.c.
.SS Limitations - unknown file size
.PP
The system does not know the file size of not-yet-generated files.
This seems to be a common problem, see
https://fuse-devel.narkive.com/tkGi5trJ/trouble-with-samba-fuse-for-files-of-unknown-size.
Any help is appreciated.
.PP
Currently, ZIPsFS reports an upper limit of the expected file size which
is not really nice.
.PP
Why cannot it be done like in /proc files (e.g.\ /proc/
.RS
/\f[I]e\f[R]\f[I]n\f[R]\f[I]v\f[R]\f[I]i\f[R]\f[I]r\f[R]\f[I]o\f[R]\f[I]n\f[R])?\f[I]C\f[R]\f[I]a\f[R]\f[I]l\f[R]\f[I]l\f[R]\f[I]i\f[R]\f[I]n\f[R]\f[I]g\f[R]\f[I]s\f[R]\f[I]t\f[R]\f[I]a\f[R]\f[I]t\f[R]/\f[I]p\f[R]\f[I]r\f[R]\f[I]o\f[R]\f[I]c\f[R]/
.RE/environ reports file size zero.
If ZIPsFS returns zero, then the content of the files are not readable.
.SS Limitations - nested, recursive
.PP
Currently, nesting (recursion) is not yet supported.
A virtual file cannot be the basis for another virtual file.
.SS ZIPsFS_autogen_queue.sh
.PP
Some exotic Wine dependent Windows executables do not work well within
ZIPsFS.
As a work around, we developed the shell script
\f[B]ZIPsFS_autogen_queue.sh\f[R].
With each pass of an infinity loop one task is taken from a queue and
processed.
One file is converted at a time per script instance.
Several instances of this shell script can run in parallel.
In the settings, the symbol \f[B]PLACEHOLDER_EXTERNAL_QUEUE\f[R] is
given instead of an executable program.

.PP
-s \f[I]path-of-symbolic-link\f[R]
.PP
After initialization the specified symlink is created and points to the
mount point.
Previously existing links are overwritten.
This allows to restart ZIPsFS without affecting running programs which
access file in the virtual ZIPsFS file system.
For file paths in the virtual file system, the symlink is used rather
than the real mount-point.
Consider a running ZIPsFS instance which needs to be replaced by a newer
one.
The new ZIPsFS instance is started with a different mount point.
Both instances work simultaneously.
The symlink which used to point to the mount point of the old instance
is now pointing to that of the new one.
The old instance should be let running for an hour or so until no file
handle is open any more.
.PP
If the symlink is within an exported SAMBA or NFS path, it should be
relative.
This is best achieved by changing into the parent path where the symlink
will be created.
Then give just the name and not the entire path of the symlink.
In the /etc/samba/smb.conf give:
.PP
follow symlinks = yes
.SS Debug Options
.PP
See ZIPsFS.compile.sh for activation of sanitizers.
.PP
-T Checks the capability to print a backtrace.
This requires addr2line which is usually in /usr/bin/ of Linux and
FreeBSD.
For MacOSX, the tool atos is used.
.SS FUSE Options
.PP
-f
.PP
Run in foreground and display some logs at stdout.
This mode is useful inside tmux.

-s
.PP
Disable multi-threaded operation to rescue ZIPsFS in case of threading
related bugs.
.PP
-o \f[I]comma separated Options\f[R]
.PP
-o allow_other
.PP

.SS Fault management
.PP
When source file structures are stored remotely, there is a risk that
they may be temporarily unavailable.
Overlay file systems typically freeze when calls to the file API block.
Conversely, ZIPsFS should continue to operate with the remaining file
roots.
This is implemented as follows: Paths starting with double slash (in the
example \f[I]//computer1/pub\f[R]) are regarded as remote paths and
treated specially.
ZIPsFS will periodically check file systems starting with a double
slash.
If the last responds was too long ago then the respective file system is
skipped.
Furthermore the stat() function to obtain the attributes for a file are
queued to be performed in extra threads.
.PP
For files which are located in ZIP files and which are first loaded
entirely into RAM, the system is also robust for interruptions and
blocks during loading.
The system will not freeze.
After some longer time it will try to load the same file from another
root or return ENOENT.
.PP
If loading of ZIP files fail, loading will be repeated after 1s.
.PP
For ZIP entries loaded entirely into the RAM, the CRC sum is validated
and possible errors are logged.
.SH FILES
.IP \[bu] 2
ZIPsFS_configuration.h and ZIPsFS_configuration.c and
ZIPsFS_configuration_autogen.c: Customizable rules.
Modification requires recompilation.
.IP \[bu] 2
\[ti]/.ZIPsFS: Contains the log file and cache and the folder a.
The later holds auto-generated files.
.SH LIMITATIONS
.SS Hard-links
.PP
Hard-links are not implemented, while symlinks work.
.SS Deleting files
.PP
Files can only be deleted when their physical location is in the first
source.
Conversely, in the FUSE file systems unionfs-fuse and fuse-overlayfs,
files can be always deleted irrespectively of their physical location.
They are canceled out without actually deleting them from their physical
location.
If you need the same behaviour please drop a request-for-feature.
.SH BUGS
